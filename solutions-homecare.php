			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><strong>Focus on the patient, not on the process. MEDITECH’s Home Care solution grants clinicians and administrative staff convenient and mobile access to everything they need – a full Electronic Health Record, shared MPI, streamlined documentation, and comprehensive financial and communication capabilities – online, offline and in-line with OASIS regulations. The software’s task-driven design provides a true workflow engine by directing staff to the next step in the care cycle—so they don’t miss  a step or a deadline.</strong>

		<h2>Field Staff/Nurses</h2>
		<p>Patient records travel with you. Care providers can use mobile devices to access full patient records, document data, and tailor care plans on the fly. No online access? No problem. Staff can securely download records to mobile devices and later upload post-visit updates to MEDITECH’s EHR, maximizing patient face time and minimizing retrospective documentation. Dropdown menus and point-and-click templates simplify documentation, while protocols and OASIS integrity checks guide practice. Care providers can use a History button to trend progress across visits and can even attach photos to a patient’s record to review visual progression of wounds or other conditions.</p>

		<h2>Hospice Staff</h2>
		<p>A unique care environment deserves a unique EHR solution. Our Hospice solution has you covered from referral and designation of benefit periods through bereavement. Hospice-specific assessments and charts keep care consistent, while still providing the flexibility to customize documentation to accommodate individual beneficiary and family needs. IDT capabilities keep care coordinated by enabling staff to record and manage meetings and other collaborative efforts. And volunteer management capabilities keep care compassionate by tracking volunteer hours, activities, and interactions with patients. And to keep your organization financially sound, Hospice supports billing by level of care and posts per diem charges to automate the billing cycle.</p>

		<h2>Billers</h2>
		<p>Zero balance is within reach. Claim management capabilities ensure accurate bill processing to keep AR days low and payments complete. Automatic charge capture, billing conditions to support compliant billing, and support for unlimited visit types simplify the process. Automated follow-up reminders and notifications keep billers on top of action items so they can complete tasks in a timely fashion.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Coordinators</h2>
		<p>AWe help you manage the big picture. Whether you’re a supervisor, an administrator, or are responsible for quality assurance, our Home Health solution has you covered. We provide tools for scheduling and assigning tasks, maintaining assessments and clinical protocols, following up on visits, and reporting back to state and federal agencies. The system intelligently pushes assignments to employees and even triggers new tasks based on completion of previous ones. Scheduling is order-driven, minimizing coordinators’ day-to-day responsibilities. Coordinators can also use the system’s standard content, protocols, and predefined assessments to foster quality, consistent care—or customize these tools based on their agency’s needs. The ability to extract meaningful data and compile robust reports is effortless with intuitive point-and-click and drag-and-drop functionality.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Hospital Staff</h2>
		<p>The benefits of our Home Health solution extend far beyond the home setting. System-wide integration connects the full care team, independent of specialty or location. A shared EHR and MPI ensure that acute and home care clinicians have access to the same patient orders, medications, allergies, vital signs, and visit notes. Streamlined e-signature and e-referral capabilities also simplify transitions from one care setting to another. Providers can even monitor patient metrics remotely using Telehealth Home Connect.</p>
