			<p><strong>Successful surgery relies upon collaboration—collaboration among schedulers, clinicians, and administrators. From scheduling through discharge, MEDITECH’s fully integrated Surgical Services solution ties it all together for optimal results.</strong>
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Dynamic Scheduling</h2>
		<p>Book, move, cancel, hold, and reschedule cases from a centralized location in an instant. Automatically link preference cards to scheduled procedures. View scheduler’s notes (“Leave wedding ring on patient”) directly from the schedule. Concerned about resource conflicts? No worries. MEDITECH automatically checks for conflicting resource schedules throughout the scheduling process. Need to move a surgery from one room to another? Drag and drop it. It’s as simple as that.</p>

		<h2>Surgical Trackers</h2>
		<p>HIPAA-compliant surgical trackers alert your staff to up-to-the-minute surgical activity. Use the tracker to get acquainted with your surgical team and the role of each team member. Track at a glance whether cases are on time, delayed, or cancelled. Need to know anesthesia start time? Cut time? One look at the tracker will tell you what you need to know. How about a tracker for the family waiting area? Build one with unique patient identifiers for confidentiality.</p>

		<h2>Point-of-care Documentation</h2>
		<p>Easily document the entire perioperative episode, from Preop through PACU. Record operative text, surgical outcomes, anesthetics, staff present, and surgical times—as well as implants, explants, and items used during the procedure. Use the embedded eMAR and Transfusion Administration Record (TAR) to safely administer medications and blood products during surgery or at the patient’s bedside. For clinicians who transition between the floor and the operating room, care providers of all specialties can document multidisciplinary care plans in real time directly from the surgical record. All documentation flows directly to the patient’s electronic record in real time for a complete picture of the patient’s health.</p>

		<h2>Inventory and Cost Tracking</h2>
		<p>Full integration with the Patient Accounting solution automatically transmits charges for used preference card items to the patient’s account. Track and analyze inventory utilization and costs in real time to avoid shortages and overages. Monitor block utilization, delays, mortality rates, and surgery durations. You can also pinpoint changes to inventory when items are lent to or borrowed from another location.</p>

		<h2>Reporting</h2>
		<p>Want to know more about operating room activity? Overruns? Delayed cases? Select from one of the 50 standard reports MEDITECH delivers with the Surgical Services solution. Alternatively, you can turn to the Director’s Desktop for executive-level reporting, or take advantage of our powerful custom reporting tools.</p>
		<p>The Surgical Services solution provides your surgical staff with simple, intuitive tools to improve the quality of patient care and maximize revenues. Dynamic scheduling, comprehensive clinical documentation, inventory control, and management reporting capabilities provide your organization with a comprehensive surgical software solution that promotes patient safety and enhances care team collaboration.</p>
