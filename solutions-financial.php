			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><strong>Focus on the patient, not on the process. MEDITECH’s Home Care solution grants clinicians and administrative staff convenient and mobile access to everything they need – a full Electronic Health Record, shared MPI, streamlined documentation, and comprehensive financial and communication capabilities – online, offline and in-line with OASIS regulations. The software’s task-driven design provides a true workflow engine by directing staff to the next step in the care cycle—so they don’t miss  a step or a deadline.</strong>

		<h2>Account Representatives</h2>
		<p>No dollar left behind. Our patient accounting tools enable you to efficiently bill and follow up oncollections and denials for one or more accounts from a centralized desktop. Create one bill for all services rendered. Daily worklists and task management keep claims moving while a color-coded chart organized by days and buckets helps you to manage the collection stream. System-wide integration prevents lost claims and denials by capturing the right information upfront for one-time billing and claims processing. You can even analyze and track current sources of denial for future prevention.</p>

Screen receivables, revenue, cash flow, claims, worklists, billing tasks, account checks, and insurance denials. Establish organizational goals and compare with current financials. Gauge staff productivity and provider revenue. Even drill down into the integrated General Ledger for more details. Have a global view of all automated system activity.</p>

		<h2>Supply Chain Staff</h2>
		<p>We help keep your costs low and your inventory up to par. Real-time inventory tracking and decrementing keeps your stock at optimal levels and notifies you when it’s time to buy. With e-commerce you can secure the best prices for supplies and electronically place orders, track  status, and submit payments. Integration between Materials Management and Accounts Payable makes it easy to convert requisitions into POs and reconcile invoices to ensure the right supplies are received at the right price. Purchasing and receiving departments can view and drill-down into the same information, eliminating unnecessary phone calls between departments.</p>

		<h2>HR and Payroll Staff</h2>
		<p>You’re responsible for building and sustaining a cohesive team. Our Human Resources solution can help. Use online applicant tracking to match openings to skills. Track employee education, licenses, and skills to ensure staff have the appropriate qualifications to deliver high quality care. And manage central employee records to track demographics, health and safety records, performance reviews, scanned forms, and much more. You can even engage employees through an online employee portal and electronically sign off on their personnel action forms. Integration with Payroll supports the processing of multiple payrolls for a single employee or an entire facility as well as reporting to government agencies.</p>
