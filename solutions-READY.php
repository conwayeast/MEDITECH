			<!-- <h2>Our EHR Completes the Puzzle</h2> -->
			<p><strong>Even the best technology will have its limits, if you’re not sure how to use it. A team of MEDITECH specialists and certified consultants will work with you from the start of you implementation, to ensure that you’re using your EHR to its fullest potential.</strong>
			</p>
			<!-- <p>We know you want the best for your patients—and our solutions may be just what the doctor ordered. With our EHR, you can keep patients safer and healthier.</p> -->
		</div>

		<h2>What is READY?</h2>
		<p>READY stands for the key hallmarks of our EHR implementation plan:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>R</strong>apid Adoption - 100% Physician Adoption from Day One</li>
			<li><strong>E</strong>vidence Based - We’re delivering the content so you don’t have to build it</li>
			<li><strong>A</strong>dvanced Workflows - We’ll work with you to optimize your workflow and align with Best Practices</li>
			<li><strong>D</strong>edicated Team - Between MEDITECH’s implementation staff and our certified consultants, you’ll be supported 24/7</li>
			<li><strong>Y</strong>our Success - Our ultimate goal!</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Taking A Three-Phased Approach</h2>
		<p>We aren’t going to deliver our software and then make you figure it out on your own. Over the course of 19 months, we’ll guide you through the three key phases of implementation: Planning and Design, Build and Train, and Post-LIVE Optimization.</p>

		<p>First, we’ll help you to establish project and governance charters, identify project teams, and conduct assessments to align your current workflow with your future functionality.</p>

		<p>Next, your teams will work with MEDITECH’s implementation specialists and our certified consultants to customize the EHR for your needs. We’ll pay particular attention to your physicians and other clinical staff, to make sure they are fully trained and ready for LIVE.</p>

		<p>Once you’re up and running, we will continue to work with you to optimize your system through evaluations and assessment visits. From start to successful finish, MEDITECH will be with you every step of the way.</p>

		<h2>Embedded Standard Content</h2>
		<p>By working with several Collaborative Solutions vendors--including IMO, Zynx, and FDB--we provide the most comprehensive standard content in the industry. Our clinical content is reviewed by MEDITECH’s physician informaticists, so it’s expert based, as well as evidence based.</p>

		<p>Your customized Problem List, Order Set, and Drug Dictionaries will come to you fully populated. That means you can spend your time using the EHR, not building it.</p>

		<h2>Getting All Leaders on Board</h2>
		<p>To ensure a smooth go-LIVE, it’s important to have support from both executive and clinical leadership. With our Clinical Leadership Preparedness Program (CLPP) we’ll advise your leaders on how they can successfully guide the project to completion. The 16-course program is led by MEDITECH physicians, who will cover such topics as communication strategies, clinical workflow analysis, and process re-engineering.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, you want 100% physician adoption on Day One. We’ll get you there with the help of MEDITECH’s clinician teams, who will train all of your physicians “at-the-elbow” to make sur they can comfortably use the EHR. Once you go LIVE, everyone on your staff will experience the benefits of a fully integrated, hospital-wide electronic health record.</p>
