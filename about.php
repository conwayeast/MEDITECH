		<p>Founded in 1969 by Neil Pappalardo, Morton E. Ruderman, Curtis W. Marble, Jerome H. Grossman and Dr. Edward B. Roberts, MEDITECH makes software to help healthcare organizations provide safe, quality care. MEDITECH was started in a 5,000 sq. ft. office in Cambridge, MA and has since grown to a company with 10 offices and over 3,800 employees who support more than 2300 healthcare organizations. Today, 2 in 5 hospitals in Canada and 1 in 4 hospitals in the U.S. are using MEDITECH.</p>

From the physician's office, to the hospital, to home-based care, and to any other location offering health services, MEDITECH is assisting clinicians to provide the best care possible. Patients and doctors can access all of this information and communicate via a smartphone or computer.</p>

		<p>MEDITECH is The EHR for New Healthcare, advancing a fully integrated and interoperable future.
