			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><strong>MEDITECH’s executive-level, analytical tools are intuitive, flexible, and easy-to-configure,giving you browser-based dashboard reporting that’s as unique as your organization. Standard dashboards included in our Business and Clinical Analytics solution summarize the data in your EHR, and let you pull in data from external sources. View trends and key performance indicators securely, whether you’re on your tablet, PC, or laptop.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>C-level and Meaningful Use dashboards organize your clinical, operational, and financial data, so you can extract, analyze, annotate, and act on the information. Drill down to see how your organization is faring and why, pinpointing areas for potential change through a variety of sort filters, selectors, and calculations. Download dashboard views to various file formats, email them to your colleagues, and print an annotated copy. Or, construct your own dashboard views to delve deeper into issues that are important to your organization.</p>

		<h2>CEO</h2>
		<p>To drive operational performance at the highest level, you need an overall perspective of yourorganization. Our analytical tools give you a high-level executive summary of clinical quality, operational, and financial data you can rearrange on your dashboard.</p>
		<p>Drill down into operational metrics, finance, and quality indicators. Analyze service lines such as obstetrics, cardiology, and oncology for revenues and costs, so you know which areas are more profitable.</p>
		<p>Improve your revenue cycle by managing contracts with payers, report on most frequent procedures, or drill down into actual versus budgeted expenses for more accurate forecasting.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>CFO</h2>
		<p>Standard dashboards help you visualize your organization’s financial performance. Keep costs in check and revenue high for ACOs, shared savings, and other reimbursement models. Revenue cycle tools help you maintain authorizations, leading to fewer denials.</p>
		<p>Real-time integration helps you see data when you want to see it, while flexible options let you decide how you want to see it. A clinical record displays all patient data in real-time, so you can see a summary of information and then drill-down for more detail. Current and historical results can be graphed, while meaningful displays and structured data ensure that you’re not wasting time hunting for the info you need.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>CIO</h2>
		<p>Make sure end users have access to all of the information they need, through ready-built end-user content. Information compiled from trackers, Status Boards, and more gives executive end-users access to transactional data without burdening your IT department. That’s because our data mart organizes your Data Repository’s transactional tables into easy-to-configure, drillable views.</p>
		<p>Our EHR helps keep your infrastructure buttoned down, but not too restrictive. System monitoring tools and reports help keep information available to those who need to know, and secure from those who don’t—no matter how large your organization is.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>CNO</h2>
		<p>As a nurse, your first concern is the health of your patients. View staffing levels, operational throughput metrics, and quality outcomes with our dashboards, to deliver the highest quality care. Examine clinical outcomes such as hospital-acquired conditions, never events, and other clinical quality indicators, and compare them to staffing levels, patient throughput, and other data elements.</p>
		<p>As an executive, you’re responsible for the health of your organization. Configure views to compare actual overtime expenses vs. budgeted overtime, to keep your organization properly staffed and fiscally efficient.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>CQO</h2>
		<p>Standard clinical quality views include outcomes measurement for The Joint Commission core measures and Meaningful Use. Compare outcomes such as hospital-acquired conditions, never events, and other clinical quality indicators to staffing levels and other data elements such as patient throughput. Track and monitor incidents, and perform process reviews for optimal efficiency.</p>
		<p>Our standard content was designed in collaboration with a large network of collaborative partners, such as Intelligent Medical Objects®, Zynx Health™, and First DataBank™. You can feel confidence in the tools and data you’re using on a daily basis, knowing that you can make the best decisions for your patients based on the most up-to-date evidence and data.</p>
