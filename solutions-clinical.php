			<p><strong>Your ancillary staff are often the unsung heroes of patient care. They perform the tests, process the results, verify and distribute the medications, and more. So shouldn’t they have access to the same integrated Electronic Health Record? With MEDITECH, ancillary departments have immediate access to real-time patient information, along with intuitive, workflow-based displays catered to their unique needs—improving productivity and turnaround. All departments share a single patient record, formulary, eMAR, patient allergy list, and transfusion administration record to prevent conflicts and improve decision making. As a result, real-time results, documentation, and medication conflicts are immediately available to the physicians and nurses who rely on them. We don’t overlook the worker bees—we value them.</p>

		<h2>Pharmacy Staff</h2>
		<p>Medications are complex enough. We keep it simple. With flexible roles-based desktops, pharmacists have all the right tools at their fingertips to efficiently and effectively manage their daily activities. From verifying patients’ medications, to managing drug inventory, to compiling reports and statistics, our desktops do everything you need from one central screen. Embedded and intelligent clinical decision support ensures safe patient care. We keep you one step ahead of potential clinical errors with full electronic interaction checking for all orders as well as centralized allergy management routines.</p>
		<p>Pharmacy is a key component of our closed-loop medication management system. Seamless integration across the EHR supports safe reconciling, ordering, filling, and administration of medications throughout the enterprise.</p>

		<h2>Laboratory Professionals</h2>
		<p>Laboratory Professionals benefit from a comprehensive and fully integrated Laboratory Information System that includes Laboratory, Microbiology, Anatomical Pathology, and Blood Bank.</p>

		<p><strong>Laboratory staff</strong> can collect, receive, track, and report on specimens and blood products with ease from centralized roles-based desktops. Phlebotomists can use wireless devices to bring their workflow to the patient’s location, from viewing collection instructions to verifying the patient’s identity via barcode scanning. And lab technicians can easily adapt our customizable desktops to fit their specimen processing and resulting needs.</p>

		<p><strong>Microbiology personnel</strong> can easily process specimens, track patient infections, and generate epidemiology reports from desktops designed with their unique workflow in mind.</p>

		<p><strong>Pathologists</strong> will appreciate reporting conveniences like voice recognition transcription, image annotation, and integration with Microsoft ® Word. Sign-out routines let pathology staff electronically or manually sign out cases and finalize result reports, either individually or in batches.</p>

		<p><strong>Blood Bank staff</strong> can be confident that our FDA 510k-cleared solution will provide the highly specialized functionality a Blood Bank depends on to operate safely and efficiently. Patient safety is at the forefront of our electronic cross matching, donor tracking, and transfusion management routines. Integration with our Patient Care System makes bar coded transfusion verification a reality, confirming the right patient is receiving the right blood product, and helps your staff document important transfusion details in real time.</p>

		<h2>Diagnostic Imaging Staff</h2>
		<p>We enhance the speed and accuracy by which Diagnostic Imaging staff can process exams and generate result reports with routines designed around the unique needs of radiology and mammography workflows.</p>
		<p>Your staff can schedule and record exams, track patients, view images, and document results - all from efficient roles-based desktops. Technologists can accurately record exam details and ensure patient safety with inherent conflict and allergy checking. Diagnostic images are accessible where and when radiologists need them through our standard PACS interface. And transcriptionists have a variety of options at their disposal to generate result reports, such as the MEDITECH text editor, integration with Microsoft Word, and voice recognition capabilities. Our mammography features are MQSA compliant and equip technicians with the tools to format questionnaires, enter exam codes, and generate the required patient and provider letters.</p>

		<h2>Therapists</h2>
		<p>All therapists—whether physical therapist, occupational therapist, respiratory therapist, or speech pathologist—play a major role in supporting interdisciplinary patient care. As such, we provide them with full integration into our EHR, along with functionality tailored to their unique workflows. Therapists track and prioritize their patients through customizable patient status boards, which display patient details and notifications relevant to their specialties. We also equip them with their own worklists for managing tasks, including support for chart and charge. Therapists collaborate on patient care by documenting evaluations and outlining treatment plans on their own customizable portion of the patient’s multidisciplinary care plan. The ability to generate interdepartmental notifications also improves communication with other care team members and facilitates handoff communication with other therapists</p>
