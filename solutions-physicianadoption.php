			<!-- <h2>Our EHR Completes the Puzzle</h2> -->
			<p><strong>Now, more than ever, physicians are the driving force behind EHR vendor decisions. We’ve implemented a number of programs and support tools to help you gain the support of your physicians, to ensure that your EHR initiatives are successful.</strong>
			</p>
			<!-- <p>We know you want the best for your patients—and our solutions may be just what the doctor ordered. With our EHR, you can keep patients safer and healthier.</p> -->

		<h2>Physician Engagement</h2>
		<p>We currently employ a team of practicing physicians to assist in our development, implementation, service, and marketing efforts. With their help, our web-based EHR is specially designed by physicians, and for physicians. This group is also reaching out to your staff via Doctor’s Hours, an hour-long, interactive Webex series that teaches physicians how to optimize their system.</p>

		<p>Your physicians can also take a major role in guiding the future progress of their EHR, through our Focus Group and Click Reduction initiatives. Focus group members influence all stages of our development process, offering their feedback after testing coded software for workflow, intuitiveness, and usability. Meanwhile, our Click Reduction team aims to streamline the navigation of our existing software to simplify a physician’s daily workflow. Oftentimes, the fruits of their labor are presented during our events, including the annual Physician Forum.</p>

		<h2>Preparing Physician Champions</h2>
		<p>Our Clinical Leadership Preparedness Program (CLPP) is like nothing we’ve ever done before— our experienced physicians become the teachers, helping your physicians prep and get ready for the implementation of Physician Care Manager. Incorporating a combination of seminars, discussions, site visits, webinars, and full-day courses, the educational series was designed by our Physician Advocacy Team, based on their own experiences and lessons learned. They’ll not only train your team on the system, they’ll also guide you through every step of the implementation.</p>

		<h2>Delivering Standard Content</h2>
		<p>Our staff and consulting physicians, nurses, and pharmacists collaborated with Zynx Health First Databank, and Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO) to build a variety of standard content, all of which have proven value with our customers. Standard content available to physicians includes acute and ED evidence-based order sets, documentation templates, rounds lists, clinical panels, as well as a number of standard dictionary entries. Having this content available out-of-the-box allows you to focus on learning the system, rather than building it.</p>

		<h2>Mobility</h2>
		<p>Our innovative mobile solutions ensure your physicians have access to their data wherever and whenever they need it. Our Mobile Rounding solution, used with any web-enabled smartphone or tablet, gives physicians access to their patients’ vital signs, test results, documentation, and more. Our web-based EHR is also optimized for use with touch-screen devices. Customers are currently in the process of implementing our web-based Ambulatory solution, with an identical set of web-based tools for acute and ED physicians just around the corner.</p>
