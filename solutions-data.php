		<h2>Maintain Quality Assurance</h2>
		<p>Not having the right data at the right time can put your quality assurance efforts in jeopardy. With MEDITECH’s EHR, care providers can access, trend, and instantly interpret real-time information from across care settings through a single patient record.</p>
		<p>Informed clinical decision-making stems from data trending views, such as graphing, lifetime patient views, and flowsheet documentation. New, critical, or abnormal values and surveillance details are pushed out to MEDITECH users as notifications on desktops, status boards, rounding lists, or clinical panels. Clinicians can easily drill down into notifications to view additional information.</p>

		<h2>Address Quality Improvement</h2>
		<p>Use analytical reporting tools to evaluate the effectiveness of care protocols and target areas for improvement. Track incidents, quality reviews, and automatic notifications to the appropriate staff for follow up. Quality managers are able to analyze quality and safety improvements, as well as ensure organizational compliance and accountability. A series of web-based, visual dashboards will help you to graph, trend, and drill down into data for improved evaluation of organizational performance.</p>

		<h2>Report Across Patient Populations</h2>
		<p>Our EHR collects real-time, actionable data for accurate patient population reporting and analytics. We help you proactively monitor your patient population’s health to improve outcomes. You can also measure quality standards and report back to CMS on conditions such as COPD or CHF.</p>
		<p>We keep data aggregation simple by collaborating with Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO) to seamlessly map clinician-friendly diagnosis and procedure nomenclature to medical concepts, resulting in high usability and accurate reports. For longitudinal analysis of data across care settings, you can use our SQL data warehouse in conjunction with any third-party, ODBC-compliant reporting tool to evaluate your patient population’s health and operational costs.</p>

		<h2>Track Reimbursement and Perform Cost Analysis</h2>
		<p>Monitor the financial pulse of your organization through comprehensive financial reporting capabilities.Empower your executives with web-based dashboards--featuring drill-down and drag-and-drop capabilities--to see reimbursement trends and cost analysis.</p>
		<p>Contract and reimbursement management reporting enables you to automatically determine the expected reimbursement from the payer(s) and the patient or guarantor. Flexible, point-and-click financial dashboards for managers provide access to high-level graphical or tabular views of receivables, revenue, cash flow, claims, monitored worklists, billing tasks, account checks, and insurance denials to promote more informed decisions.</p>
		<p>With our cost accounting capabilities, you can take it a step further and analyze costs incurred by patients in a particular department, determine the overall profitability of a specific patient or department, as well as compute the net profit or loss. You can also readily meet cost accounting requirements mandated by ACOs.</p>
