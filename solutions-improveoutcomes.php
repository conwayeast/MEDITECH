			<h2>Our EHR Completes the Puzzle</h2>
			<p><strong>Healthcare today is all about bringing many different pieces of information together, to produce better outcomes for patients. MEDITECH’s EHR can help providers to complete the quality care puzzle, by enhancing clinical communication, preventing medical errors and hospital-acquired infections, as well as tracking process improvements.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We know you want the best for your patients—and our solutions may be just what the doctor ordered. With our EHR, you can keep patients safer and healthier.</p>

		<h2>Patient Safety &amp; Quality Care</h2>
		<p>MEDITECH’s mission is, and always has been, to create software that enables physicians, nurses, and other clinicians to deliver safe and effective patient care. Here’s how we do it:</p>
		<h3>By giving healthcare providers access to accurate and complete patient histories.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Enhance communication between providers and at all points of care.</strong> Our centralized, integrated, mobile,and readily interoperable EHR provides real-time access to patient records, timely notifications via status boards, and ED trackers.</li>
			<li><strong>Push for patient involvement.</strong> Motivate your patients to be aware and in control of their care, by giving them access to the Patient and Consumer Health Portal. Patients can view their health summary, see lab results, message providers, make appointments, pay bills, and be an active participant in their care.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>By identifying at-risk patients, and preventing potential errors.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Prevent infections and medication mistakes, while increasing patient satisfaction.</strong> Establish protocols to prevent infections caused by catheters and ventilators. Manage patient populations with clinical decision support tools and a Data Repository that pulls data from across the entire MEDITECH EHR, as well as external sources. Administer medications safely with CPOE, Medication Reconciliation, and Bedside Verification.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduce readmissions with patient care best practices.</strong> Manage order sets and care plans via our READY implementation plan. Prevent readmissions by preparing patients for discharge and ensuring they follow  through with treatment with the use of our Patient Portal and Telehealth solutions.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>By providing cost-effective ways to comply with government regulations and track quality improvements.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Pull meaningful patient data in seconds and manage quality.</strong> Our EHR offers real-time awareness and documentation. You have the ability to review processes at any time with physician and ED trackers, as well as nursing status boards. We provide support, documentation, ARRA Best Practices, and other reports to keep you on the quality track.</li>
			<li><strong>Incident Reporting with Risk Management.</strong> Document issues and target improvement areas to reduce by putting protocols in place to protect your patients.</li>
			<li><strong>Verify cost reduction and quality improvement efforts.</strong> Compare clinical outcomes and cost of care delivery with tracking/reports, and decision support.</li>
