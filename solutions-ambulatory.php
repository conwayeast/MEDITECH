		<h2>Complete Patient Continuity</h2>
		<p>With MEDITECH, your practice can leverage data from across your care network. That’s because our Practice Management solution is fully integrated with other components of your MEDITECH EHR, creating a true single record solution. One patient record across the entire continuum of care, simultaneously enhancing safety, efficiency, and quality of care -- all while maintaining your own workflows, practice styles, and even financial data. It’s the power of MEDITECH’s EHR with the flexibility your practices need.</p>

		<h2>Mobility for All</h2>
		<p>Set your physicians free with our all-new touch-based interface, designed by and for physicians to run on iPads and other tablets -- and watch their efficiency soar with a shared toolset for CPOE and Physician Documentation between acute and ambulatory environments. Use your favorite device and web browser to manage schedules, document visits, review results, prescribe, order, e-sign, and much more. And leverage any combination of voice recognition, handwriting recognition, dictation, and specialty-specific templates to document patient visits your way. With MEDITECH’s anytime, anywhere web-based access, your providers and staff will experience new levels of efficiency and productivity.</p>

		<h2>Streamlined Communications</h2>
		<p>The MEDITECH EHR helps you stay in sync with every member of your team . . . including your patients. Respond promptly to phone calls, route diagnostic results, process prescription refill requests, prioritize and direct tasks, and much more. Boost engagement with our Patient and Consumer Health Portal -- your patients’ one-stop-shop for requesting prescriptions renewals and follow-up appointments, reviewing lab results and radiology reports, viewing/downloading/transmitting their health summary, paying bills, and securely communicating with their care team. See how streamlining your communications enhances your practice’s efficiency and improves your bottom line.</p>

		<h2>Scheduling Across Your Enterprise</h2>
		<p>Make scheduling conflicts a thing of the past with real-time, enterprise-wide conflict checking. Dramatically reduce missed and cancelled appointments with smart waitlisting functionality, and book appointments for your own facility or for any location across your care network -- in the hospital or other affiliated clinics -- from a single, intuitive scheduling application. That’s the power of enterprise-wide scheduling.</p>

		<h2>Improved Revenue Cycle Management</h2>
		<p>Enhance your practice's financial health with MEDITECH’s powerful billing and collection tools -- and watch your A/R days drop with your leaner revenue cycle. Promptly identify and follow up on delinquent payments using robust collections worklists; track and manage all financial data from a single Financial Status Desktop; and simplify life for your patients and staff with our single bill functionality.</p>

		<h2>Robust Reporting</h2>
		<p>Leverage Practice Management’s standard reports and tight integration with Data Repository to experience the power of reporting without boundaries. Zoom in and out on clinical and financial data from within your practice, across practices, acute settings, and beyond. Generate powerful standard and ad hoc reports -- including A/R, reimbursement, and month-end reports, as well as operational and executive summaries. Keep your finger on the pulse of your practice with intuitive, customizable dashboards to demonstrate you’re delivering efficient, high-quality care -- and stay ahead of the curve with Meaningful Use, P4P, ACOs, PCMH and other state and federal initiatives.</p>
