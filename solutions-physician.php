			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p><strong>Consumer demands. Government mandates. New reimbursement models. You face enough challenges; adopting electronic health records shouldn’t be one of them.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>MEDITECH is here to help. Our web-based EHR works WITH your workflow, not against it. Standard content, evidence-based medicine, real-time data sharing, and inherent decision support tools will help guide your decisions so you can focus on more important matters - your patients.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Mobility</h2>
		<p>On the go? Our mobile solutions give you access to patient information on a smartphone or tablet device from wherever you may be - the hospital, your office, the patient’s bedside, or on the road. Run from a secure browser in real-time, patient data is both accessible and secure in your hands.</p>

		<h2>Usability</h2>
		<p>You asked, we delivered. Our physician team contributes directly to MEDITECH’s ongoing development and usability processes, to ensure that the EHR supports your daily workflow with a minimum of clicks.</p>
		<p>Real-time integration helps you see data when you want to see it, while flexible options let you decide how you want to see it. A clinical record displays all patient data in real-time, so you can see a summary of information and then drill-down for more detail. Current and historical results can be graphed, while meaningful displays and structured data ensure that you’re not wasting time hunting for the info you need.</p>

		<h2>Flexibility</h2>
		<p>From roles-based desktops to customizable clinical panels, you can decide what’s most important to you. Our CPOE and physician documentation solutions allow you to save favorites-- helping to streamline your workflow and making the orders and templates you use the most readily accessible. And with user preferences, you set the level of alerts you receive so that alert fatigue is no longer an issue.</p>
