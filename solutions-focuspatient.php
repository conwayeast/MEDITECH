			<h2>Our EHR Completes the Puzzle</h2>
			<p><strong>Healthcare today is all about bringing many different pieces of information together, to produce better outcomes for patients. MEDITECH’s EHR can help providers to complete the quality care puzzle, by enhancing clinical communication, preventing medical errors and hospital-acquired infections, as well as tracking process improvements.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We know you want the best for your patients—and our solutions may be just what the doctor ordered. With our EHR, you can keep patients safer and healthier.</p>

		<h2>Improve Transition of Care</h2>
		<p>MEDITECH’s EHR simplifies transition of care by giving everyone on a patient’s care team easy access to relevant patient information. Inherent, system-wide integration effortlessly shares data between care areas through an enterprise-wide Electronic Health Record. For those outside your network, our EHR supports interoperable solutions like CCD Exchange and Direct Messaging to ensure all those involved in a patient’s care stay informed. Patients can also view, download, or transmit their CCD using our Patient Portal.</p>

		<h2>Streamline the Discharge Process</h2>
		<p>Important patient information... to go. Our EHR lets you document and distribute third-party discharge and educational materials specific to patients’ care, visits, and medications. Whether handed to patients in hardcopy or accessed via our Patient Portal, this information helps to keep them educated and engaged in their care after leaving your facility. You can also refer patients to Home Health services, with patient demographic and discharge information carrying forward into our integrated Home Care solution.</p>

		<h2>Extend Your Reach</h2>
		<p>Keep watch over your patients from miles away. Our integrated Home Care and Telehealth solutions extend your reach of care – keeping patients healthy and preventing readmissions. With Telehealth, patients record their own vitals through monitoring devices. Information is sent to the EHR and nurses and other care providers are alerted to concerning trends.</p>

		<h2>Make Their Lives Easier</h2>
		<p>Do your part to help simplify patients’ busy lives. Our Patient and Consumer Health Portal makes it easy for patients and authorized family members to manage aspects of their healthcare – from logistics to lab results – on their terms. Using the Portal, patients can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Request appointments</strong> 24/7, even outside of business hours.</li>
			<li><strong>Preregiste</strong>r</strong> to make sure their demographics are up-to-date.</li>
			<li><strong>See important data</strong>, such as lab results and radiology reports, with a few clicks.</li>
			<li><strong>Request renewals</strong> for prescriptions without calling their doctor or pharmacy.</li>
			<li><strong>Pay bills</strong> online with no stamp required.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Keep Them Engaged</h2>
		<p>MEDITECH’s EHR encourages patients to remain connected with their care providers, to be cognizant of their wellness, and to take advantage of resources that support better health. Our solutions help patients remain:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Connected</strong> via direct patient-physician communication using the Portal’s Provider Messaging.</li>
			<li><strong>Informed</strong>r</strong> to make sure their demographics are up-to-date.</li>
			<li><strong>Educated</strong> through the Portal’s external links to clinical content and visit-specific materials.</li>
		</ul>
