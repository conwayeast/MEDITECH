			<p>Here’s how we help:</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Leverage Quality to Prevent Loss</h2>
		<p>Sharing information between all levels of patient care directly correlates to quality care delivery and reduces operating costs. MEDITECH’s fully integrated EHR helps you to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Flag duplicate or unnecessary orders and procedures.</li>
			<li>Alert schedulers of duplicate or overlapping appointments.</li>
			<li>Enforce documentation standards and care protocols.</li>
			<li>Record conditions present on admission and monitor patients at risk for HACs.</li>
			<li>Perform conflict checks to prevent errors and reduce liability risks.</li>
			<li>Lower readmissions with discharge planning, patient portal, and telehealth capabilities.</li>
			<li>Predict populations predisposed to chronic diseases for early detection and care.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reduce Costs without Compromising Quality Care</h2>
		<p>Going paperless with an integrated electronic EHR has its obvious cost savings, from lower paper and storage costs to reduced transcription costs. However, including integrated financial and employee management functionality provides additional cost savings. Human Resources helps you recruit and retain the most qualified staff and track licensing and education to prevent disruption of work and resulting overtime. You can even calculate nurse staffing based on patient acuity levels. Supply Chain Management helps you order the right supplies, at the right time, for the right price to prevent both excess and shortages. And by painting an accurate picture of a patient’s total cost of care throughout the care cycle, you can identify waste, control costs, and evaluate more efficient processes.</p>

		<h2>Manage Reimbursement</h2>
		<p>We hold the keys to high reimbursement rate success. MEDITECH helps you prevent denied claims, capture every charge, and reduce AR days. The Revenue Cycle process begins at first contact by capturing upfront information, collecting accurate co-pays, and checking for eligibility, authorization, and medical necessity. System integration ensures application charges automatically flow to billing while integration with Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO) promotes accurate coding through standard nomenclature mapping. Patient Accounting staff can efficiently manage the reimbursement cycle for the life of the claim from contract management and claim checking to collection and denial analysis. We ensure that no dollar is left behind.</p>

		<h2>Increase Profitability</h2>
		<p>Target every opportunity and boost your bottom line with MEDITECH’s financials leading the way. By evaluating contract performance, you can renegotiate and discover carve-out opportunities. You can accurately measure staff salaries, wages, and scheduling as well as conduct daily productivity analysis for optimal staffing. You can forecast expenses and project revenue, while also analyzing profit and evaluating cost for each service provided. Finally, by knowing your patient population and surrounding services, you can expand or create unique services to gain competitive advantage.</p>

		<h2>Measure Financial Health</h2>
		<p>Never miss a detail. MEDITECH’s financial solutions provide access to a complete, drill-down record of financial expenses, enabling you to generate financial statements and evaluate profit vs. loss. Perform detailed actual vs. budgeted analysis. Track assets and project depreciation. And use ad-hoc tools, an inherent system reporting engine, or a SQL data warehouse to create custom financial reports and views. You can also pinpoint key performance indicators with our pre-built, web-based business and clinical analytics dashboards.</p>
