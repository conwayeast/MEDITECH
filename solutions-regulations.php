			<p><strong>MEDITECH has the resources you need to comply with government regulations and adapt your organization to changing business models. We’ll support your goals with:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>ARRA/Meaningful Use (MU)</li>
				<li>ICD-10</li>
				<li>Healthcare Reform (ACOs and PCMHs)</li>
				<li>HIPAA</li>
				<li>Canadian &amp; UK-specific Mandates</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our Regulatory Review Board tracks industry changes and regulatory requirements, allowing us to clearly define them as a part of our development process. With MEDITECH, you’ll be fully informed and equipped to meet all
			federal and regional requirements.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>ARRA/Meaningful Use</h2>
		<p>Over 660 organizations have already attested for Meaningful Use, using MEDITECH. We’ve helped our customers to succeed by staying ahead of new requirements, participating in Health IT Policy meetings, and certifying all of our platforms for Meaningful Use. We can help you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be implementation ready from the start with built-in MU reports and tools</li>
			<li>Optimize your EHR with best practice documentation and training</li>
			<li>Prepare for your future with support that keeps your EHR up to MU standards.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>ICD-10</h2>
		<p>MEDITECH is meeting ICD-10 challenges, with compliant updates including lengthened code fields, enhanced coding features, and support for dual coding. We offer an online resource center and ongoing webinars to keep our customers in the know.</p>

		<p>We’re also making it easier for organizations to code through our collaboration with Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO®), which provides mapping of diagnostic terminologies to medical concepts. Clinicians can enter a diagnosis for a patient using the same descriptive language they would use in conversation with a patient or colleague, and the EHR retrieves the appropriate ICD--10 code.</p>

		<h2>Health Care Reform (ACOs &amp; PCMHs)</h2>
		<p>Is your organization an Accountable Care Organization, looking to form an ACO, or interested in joining an existing one? Do you have practices that have been recognized as Patient Centered Medical Homes, or are you interested in helping your practices move toward the PCMH model? If so, MEDITECH’s EHR has you covered.</p>
		<p>Our EHR puts care coordination at the forefront, focusing on both patient safety and cost control for whichever business model you choose. We do it by:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Providing access to information:</strong> Integrated and interoperable solutions provide timely access to complete records</li>
			<li><strong>Facilitating patient engagement:</strong> Health maintenance/disease management, a combined acute and ambulatory patient portal, home care, and telehealth offerings help you engage, educate, and monitor your patients</li>
			<li><strong>Offering decision support:</strong> Evidence-based medicine, clinical decision support, and real-time notifications all contribute to healthier outcomes</li>
			<li><strong>Providing comprehensive reporting:</strong> Real-time, customizable reports help you monitor at-risk populations, identify areas of improvement, and report quality metrics to governing agencies</li>
			<li><strong>Encouraging fiscal responsibility:</strong> Increase your shared savings by using integrated clinical and financial solutions to prevent unreimbursed services, identify financial drains, and ensure accurate reimbursement</li>
			<li><strong>Assisting you with READY implementations:</strong> Our Implementation team works with you to enforce best practices, promote user adoption, and optimize department workflow.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>HIPAA</h2>
		<p>Since the initial release of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, MEDITECH has closely followed the requirements established by the Federal government, and has enhanced our software to facilitate compliance. We offer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Security and privacy functionality, including industry standard TLS encryption</li>
			<li>ANSI 5010 versions of EDI transactions and supported code sets</li>
			<li>Support for expanded ARRA security requirements and breach notification standards</li>
			<li>A Business Associate Agreement with all contracts.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Canadian &amp; UK-specific Mandates</h2>
		<p>As a global company, we stay on top of local regulations for all customers. For example, we support requirements for the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NHS and Information Standards Board (ISB) in the UK</li>
			<li>Canadian and provincial legislation, such as CIHI</li>
			<li>Other international regulations through our partnership with MEDITECH South Africa.</li>
		</ul>
