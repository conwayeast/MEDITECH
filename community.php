		<h1>The MEDITECH Community</h1>
		<p>As a company, we make every effort to have a positive effect on the world around us. Check out a few of the ways MEDITECH is helping improve our community as a whole.</p>

		<h2>Charities We Support</h2>
		<P>We are proud to support a number of charities in both the New England and Atlanta areas. Throughout the year we host blood drives at our facilities, to help the healthcare community. During the holidays, many MEDITECH employees participate in the Adopt a Family program, donating gifts to a local family in need, which they then hand deliver. Whether cultural, educational, or social causes, we believe in giving back. If your organization is interested in developing a relationship with MEDITECH, please review our application guidelines.
		</P>

		<h2>Passion for Learning</h2>
		<p>MEDITECH is a company that appreciates and promotes higher learning. In 2010, we developed a relationship with Northeastern University to create a version of our software for their health science students, making them the first university to integrate EHR software into the classroom setting.</p>
		<p>In 2013, MEDITECH was honored to be named “Employer of the Year” at Bridgewater State University. MEDITECH has a long standing relationship with the university, employing over 200 BSU graduates from more than 23 different majors. By developing strong relationships with these universities, we show our support and passion for higher learning as a major asset in driving technology.</p>
		<p>Additionally, MEDITECH makes every effort to promote science and technology education by sending volunteers from our company to take part in programs like DIGITS (a division of the STEMTech Alliance) and by participating in WITsOn (Women in Technology Sharing Online).</p>
		<p>At local college career centers, our recruiting staff often holds resume critiques and mock interviews- dedicating their time to help students start their careers, even if it isn’t here at MEDITECH. We know that the only way to further expand our industry is through educating the next generation of technology professionals.</p>

		<h2>Getting Creative</h2>
		<p>Our company believes in supporting the arts, not just through charity work, but by participating in the art community. Every wall in our buildings is covered in works from local artists. Whether sculptural, paint, mixed media, or other format, the variety of works on display at all our locations promotes local artists, and creates an environment of creative thinking in our offices.</p>
