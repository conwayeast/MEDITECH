			<p><strong>Every clinician has his or her own workflow. And, depending upon your needs and your patients’, workflows can change in a moment. MEDITECH’s fully integrated, real-time EHR helps guide the care you provide minute by minute.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<p>Create documentation templates that meet your needs. We deliver hundreds of evidence-based, standard templates, but if you don’t find exactly what you need, you can build it—no programming knowledge required. Direct caregivers to the next logical step in patient care with embedded conditional logic. Attach protocols to care plans and assessments to ensure clinicians follow standard policies and procedures. Use flowsheets and graphing functionality to track and trend patient progress.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Collaboration</h2>
		<p>It’s all about teamwork, and today’s multidisciplinary care teams stay up to speed with our real-time Status Board and patient trackers. Need a reliable hand-off communication tool? Want to know which patients are at risk for falls? One look at your Status Board tells you what you need to know.</p>
		<p>No more searching through paper medical records—electronic records travel with you on your mobile device. Access patient charts and document multidisciplinary care wherever you want, whenever you want. Use interprovider messaging capabilities for efficient, real-time communication among colleagues.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Safety</h2>
		<p>Help make medication errors a thing of the past with Bedside Verification. Scan bar codes on patient wristbands and medication labels to verify the "Five Rights" of medication administration: Right Dosage, Right Route, Right Time, Right Patient, and Right Medication. Similarly, scan and verify blood products with information stored in a patient's Transfusion Administration Record (TAR) to meet the "Five Rights" of transfusion management: Right Patient, Right Blood Product, Right Donor, Right Patient, and Right Expiration Date. Instantly review associated data captured in other care settings, such as lab results and diagnostic reports, to help with decision making.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Quality</h2>
		<p>Need to track high risk patients? The Status Board is an active surveillance tool. Whether at risk for falls, VTE, or MRSA, Status Boards give you the information you need at a glance. For more advanced data needs, use our Business and Clinical Analytics solution to analyze outcome patterns and trends. Generate interactive, flexible dashboards and use advanced graphing and analytical capabilities to manipulate data on web-enabled mobile devices.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Specialties</h2>
